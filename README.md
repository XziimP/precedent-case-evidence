# precedent-case-evidence in regards to case # 16CR81721

* This repo contains evidence I have obtained of actual Klamath County criminal case documents that should set a precedent for my case.

* I can also now bring this evidence with me to court if so needed to show the unfair treatment I have received.

* This evidence can also be used to show that K. Buskirk is not credible and mentally un-stable.
