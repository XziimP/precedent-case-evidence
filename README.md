# precedent-case-evidence in regards to case 16CR81721 and making comparison to case 0801909CV Christian J. Selph Vs. K. Buskirk and or Klamath County

* This repo contains evidence I have obtained of actual Klamath County criminal case documents that should set a precedent for my case.

* I can also now bring this evidence with me to court if so needed to show the unfair treatment I have received.

* This evidence can also be used to show that K. Buskirk is not credible and mentally un-stable and has a pattern of having issues with male partners.

* Over all this evidence shows that under similar situations someone like Christian J. Selph gets away with actual physical abuse
  with excuse of being intoxicated with alcohol. The arresting officers never checked my Blood alcohol level and led me to believe if I told the 
  truth they would let me go. We all know what truth they wanted they wanted me to say I was guilty so I did unfortunately.
  
  
  Christian Selph wasn't even slapped on the wrist for his actions as where I have been given an unofficial death sentence 
  because I supposively pointed a big knife at someone.
  From now on I will not put up with this injustice any longer. Drop my case thank you.
  
  Klamath County tried to use me to virtue signal and point attention away from all of the sex offenders they cater to and
  have a high population of sex offenders in Klamath.
  
  Another example "Gary Using" was let out of jail after only a few weeks was released with no punisment. Not long after released Gary Using was arrested for
  shooting a person to death. Why were his gun rites not taken away in the first place?
  
  We also have officers in Klamath stealing drugs and what not from their evidence room only to end up in a car crash because their so high from the drugs lol!
  No doubt my knife was probably stolen from the evidence room and given to one of their kids that are probably torturing cats or something god only knows..
  
  Klamath County definitely has their priorities misguided to say the least. Maybe if Klamath would stop spending so much money on extradeiting every
  John & Jane for any little thing because they weren't special you might be able to afford to feed your prisoners for once.
