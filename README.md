# precedent-case-evidence in regards to case # 16CR81721

* This repo contains evidence I have obtained of actual Klamath County criminal case documents that should set a precedent for my case.

* I can also now bring this evidence with me to court if so needed to show the unfair treatment I have received.

* This evidence can also be used to show that K. Buskirk is not credible and mentally un-stable.

* Over all this evidence shows that under similar situations someone like Christian J. Selph gets away with actual physical abuse
  with excuse of being intoxicated with alcohol. The arresting officers never checked my Blood alcohol level and led me to believe if I told the 
  truth they would let me go. We all know what truth they wanted they wanted me to say I was guilty so I did unfortunately.
  
  From now on I will not put up with this injustice any longer. Drop my case thank you.
